Its Convolutional Neural Networks Self-Driving Car
Technolpogies:
Raspberry Pi 4 as a brain and OpenCV 4,
TensorFlow  in Python3 programming language.
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input frame, 
assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the frame (image) and be able to predictand  steering.
